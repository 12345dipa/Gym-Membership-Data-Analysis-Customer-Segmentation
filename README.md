# Gym-Membership-Data-Analysis-Customer-Segmentation
End-to-end data analysis project using Python to analyze gym membership data, perform customer segmentation, and identify high-value members using machine learning.

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing gym membership data to understand customer behavior, engagement levels, and service usage. Using Python-based data analytics and machine learning techniques, the project converts raw gym data into meaningful business insights that can help improve customer retention and revenue.



##  Objectives
- Analyze gym member behavior and workout patterns  
- Identify high-value and highly engaged members  
- Segment customers based on workout behavior  
- Support data-driven decision-making for gym management  



##  Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- SciPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  



##  Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (consistency score, engagement level)  
- KPI analysis (total members, premium members, PT users, sauna users)  
- Data visualization (gender distribution, membership type, workout time, popular classes)  
- Statistical testing using **t-test** to compare workout duration  
- Customer segmentation using **K-Means clustering**  
- Predictive modeling using **Logistic Regression** to identify high-value members  



##  Machine Learning Techniques
- **K-Means Clustering**: Used to segment gym members based on visit frequency, workout duration, and age  
- **Logistic Regression**: Used to predict whether a member is a high-value (highly engaged) customer  



##  Business Impact
- Helps identify high-value and loyal gym members  
- Supports targeted marketing and personalized offers  
- Improves customer retention strategies  
- Enables data-driven decisions instead of assumptions  



##  Dataset
The dataset contains gym membership details such as:
- Age, gender  
- Visit frequency  
- Average workout time  
- Membership type  
- Personal training usage  
- Group class preferences
